### Pookalam Description
Brief description about your pookalam. What makes it special and different.

### Technologies Used 
Python – for coding the logic and drawing.

Turtle Graphics – to create the spirograph design and shapes.

VS Code – as the code editor.

Git & GitHub – for version control and sharing the project.
